I made an app that produce random sales data to support the supply chain for a coffee shop business using JavaScript.
I made a page "index" that will be the user interface for the business using HTML and CSS.
I converted the app to be an object oriented by creating a contractor function and recreating the objects using it
For the styling, you can scroll at the main page to see the menu and the contact info beside the working hours and then you can click on "sales dashboard" to go sales dashboard.

* How did this go, overall?
* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

# Day 1

1. it was tough.

2. I understand each concept as a unit but sadly, it was hard for me to make everything work together.

3. nearly 6 hours.

# Day 2

1. easier than yesterday, did not take a lot of time. 
2. The  contractor function is way much easier than the objects literal. 
3. 3 hours maybe.
